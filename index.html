            <h1>FountainAI — Foundational Statement</h1>
            <p><strong>FountainAI</strong> is the infrastructural heart of the <strong>Fountain Coach</strong> organization. It was created to extend presence — the felt continuity that allows transformation to unfold across time.</p>
            <p>In coaching or therapy, presence is more than shared attention. It is a subtle attunement: a field of meaning that holds what is fragile, unfinished, or quietly emerging. When the session ends, that field often dissolves. FountainAI exists to sustain it.</p>
            <p>FountainAI does not advise, diagnose, or simulate empathy. It listens structurally and semantically — noticing the slow recurrence of images, metaphors, and tensions through which a person’s self‑understanding takes shape. When a phrase like “I’m like glass” later returns as “I feel translucent,” FountainAI recognizes continuity, not coincidence. It remembers without interpreting.</p>
            <p>This is not an agent but an <em>architecture of remembering</em>. It preserves threads of meaning, providing continuity between moments of reflection. Each connected system — PB‑VRT, MIDI 2, Fountain Store, and related agents — serves this larger intention: to make the machine capable of <em>holding space</em> rather than <em>filling it</em>.</p>

            <h2>Principles</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Presence over performance</strong> — Systems should support human reflection, not replace it.</li>
              <li><strong>Continuity over completion</strong> — What matters is that meaning can return, not that it is resolved.</li>
              <li><strong>Transparency over simulation</strong> — The mechanisms of memory and drift are visible and reproducible.</li>
              <li><strong>Ethics of quiet attention</strong> — Data is treated as resonance, not as resource.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>MIDI 2 — Core Library</h2>
            <p>The organization stewards a Swift 6 library for building and parsing MIDI 2.0 Universal MIDI Packets (<strong>UMP</strong>). Generated from the normative JSON Schema and OpenAPI definitions, it provides full coverage of the MIDI 2.0 specification: core UMP structures, SysEx7/SysEx8 streaming utilities, MIDI‑CI envelope helpers, and a teaching‑oriented <code>midi2demo</code> CLI for experimenting with the spec. The package ships with a Core MIDI adapter (TeatroAppleBridge), examples, and tests.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Complete MIDI 2.0 encoder/decoder coverage</li>
              <li>SysEx7/SysEx8 helpers and MIDI‑CI envelopes</li>
              <li>Teaching‑oriented <code>midi2demo</code> CLI with man page</li>
              <li>Core MIDI bridge for sending/receiving UMP</li>
            </ul>
