<h1 dir="auto">Fountain Coach — Extending Presence</h1>
<h2 dir="auto">FountainAI — Foundational Statement</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>FountainAI</strong> is the infrastructural heart of the <strong>Fountain Coach</strong> organization.<br>
It was created to extend presence — the felt continuity that allows transformation to unfold across time.</p>
<p dir="auto">In coaching or therapy, presence is more than shared attention.<br>
It is a subtle attunement: a field of meaning that holds what is fragile, unfinished, or quietly emerging.<br>
When the session ends, that field often dissolves. FountainAI exists to sustain it.</p>
<p dir="auto">FountainAI does not advise, diagnose, or simulate empathy.<br>
It listens structurally and semantically — noticing the slow recurrence of images, metaphors, and tensions<br>
through which a person’s self-understanding takes shape.<br>
When a phrase like <em>“I’m like glass”</em> later returns as <em>“I feel translucent,”</em><br>
FountainAI recognizes continuity, not coincidence.<br>
It remembers without interpreting.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is not an agent but an <strong>architecture of remembering</strong>.<br>
It preserves threads of meaning, providing continuity between moments of reflection.<br>
Each connected system — PB-VRT, MIDI 2, Fountain Store, and related agents —<br>
serves this larger intention: to make the machine capable of <em>holding space</em> rather than <em>filling it.</em></p>
<h3 dir="auto">Principles</h3>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Presence over performance</strong> – Systems should support human reflection, not replace it.</li>
<li><strong>Continuity over completion</strong> – What matters is that meaning can return, not that it is resolved.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency over simulation</strong> – The mechanisms of memory and drift are visible and reproducible.</li>
<li><strong>Ethics of quiet attention</strong> – Data is treated as resonance, not as resource.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Through these principles, FountainAI turns software into a medium for accompaniment —<br>
a way for technology to participate in the unfolding of presence itself.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">MIDI 2 — Core Library</h2>
<p dir="auto">The organization stewards a Swift 6 library for building and parsing MIDI 2.0 Universal MIDI Packets (<strong>UMP</strong>). Generated from the normative JSON Schema and OpenAPI definitions, it provides full coverage of the MIDI 2.0 specification: core UMP structures, SysEx7/SysEx8 streaming utilities, MIDI‑CI envelope helpers, and a teaching‑oriented <code class="notranslate">midi2demo</code> CLI for experimenting with the spec. The package ships with a Core MIDI adapter (TeatroAppleBridge), examples, and tests.</p>
<p dir="auto">Highlights</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Complete MIDI 2.0 encoder/decoder coverage</li>
<li>SysEx7/SysEx8 helpers and MIDI‑CI envelopes</li>
<li>Teaching‑oriented <code class="notranslate">midi2demo</code> CLI with man page</li>
<li>Core MIDI bridge for sending/receiving UMP</li>
</ul>
